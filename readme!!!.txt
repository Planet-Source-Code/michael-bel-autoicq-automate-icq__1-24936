What is AutoICQ?
================

AutoICQ is a utility that can be used to automate the ICQ client
(the Mirabilis one) eg. schedule functions to be done by ICQ in 
the future, without supervision. the current Beta version allowes 
you to schedule your UIN status change (online, away, offline , 
dnd, free for chat,etc...)
and also allows you to schedule the sending of messages
to other ICQ users, by your ICQ client. future versions will
 include the possibility to schedule file sending as well.
this app uses some of the ICQ API Calls using ICQMAPI.DLL , 
that should be located in your windows system folder in 
order for the program to run!
if you are a develepor and would like to use the ICQ API,
you should obtain a license key from Mirabilis, it's free,
